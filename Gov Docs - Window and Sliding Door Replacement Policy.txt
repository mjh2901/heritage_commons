HERITAGE COMMONS HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION
Standard for Sliding Door and Window Frame Replacement

The Board of Directors has considered the fact that the aluminum sliding glass door and window frames originally installed on our buildings are now outdated, difficult and expensive to obtain, more difficult to install and no longer cost effective and efficient.

The Board has clarified the type of replacement of sliding glass door and window frames that will be approved after an architectural request is submitted.

    -   The replacement should not be aluminum, but rather a more energy efficient material such as vinyl
    
    -   They should be white in color
    
    -   Any other changes to the appearance of the windows or sliding glass doors, such as a change in the arrangement or number of glass pane must be submitted on an Architectural Application and approved by the Board of Directors prior to installation.
