HERITAGE COMMONS HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION
GAS LINE POLICY

1. Pursuant to CC&R Section 8.4.1, each Owner is responsible for providing maintenance, repair and replacement of all natural gas lines that serve only that Unit, regardless of whether they are located inside or outside of the Unit.

2. Once the Association becomes aware of any necessary natural gas line repairs, it shall inform the subject Owner who will have five days to make all necessary repairs. In the event the Owner fails to do so within this five day period, the Association will cause the repair to be made, for which the Owner will be financially and legally responsible. The Association is advised that the estimated cost of the standard repair is approximately $2,500.

3. The cost of any such gas line repair will be levied against the Owner as a Reimbursement Assessment, which shall be subject to all collection remedies and charges legally available to the Association.

4. If an Owner requests that the Association make the necessary repairs, the Owner shall agree to be immediately subject to a Reimbursement Assessment covering all costs as set forth above.

5. Whenever the Association causes the necessary repair to be made to a gas line, the Owner of the affected Unit(s) shall indemnify and hold the Association harmless for all work performed.

6. Any Owners informed by PG&E that their natural gas line needs to be repaired shall contact the Associationâ€™s manager, Denise DiGregorio of Bay Area Property Services at (925) 746-0542 ext. 110, immediately.
