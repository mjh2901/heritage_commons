HERITAGE COMMONS HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION
Water LINE POLICY

1.  AUTHORIZATION
    
    Pursuant to CC&R Section 8.4.1, each Owner is responsible for providing maintenance, repair and replacement of all water lines that serve only that Unit, regardless of whether they are located inside or outside of the Unit.  Owner responsibility for water line begins at the meter.  

2.  NOTICE
    
    2.1 Once the Association becomes aware of any necessary water line repairs, it shall inform the subject Owner who will have five days to make all necessary repairs. In the event the Owner fails to do so within this five day period, the Association will cause the repair to be made, for which the Owner will be financially and legally responsible. The Association is advised that the estimated cost of the standard repair is approximately $6,000.

    2.2 The HOA may have a licensed plumber shut water off to the unit at the meter at the owners expense without contacting the owner should the leak be visible from the front or rear of the unit.

3.  COSTS

    3.1 The cost of any such water line repair will be levied against the Owner as a Reimbursement Assessment, which shall be subject to all collection remedies and charges legally available to the Association.

    3.2 Owner is responsible for all costs, and legal fees incured by the HOA in enforcing this policy.

4.  REQUESTS
    
    If an Owner requests that the Association make the necessary repairs, the Owner shall agree to be immediately subject to a Reimbursement Assessment covering all costs as set forth above.

5.  INDEMNITY

    Whenever the Association causes the necessary repair to be made to a water line, the Owner of the affected Unit(s) shall indemnify and hold the Association harmless for all work performed.

6.  REQUIREMENTS

    Water service lines between the meter and point of entry into the unit shall be replaced with a copper line.
