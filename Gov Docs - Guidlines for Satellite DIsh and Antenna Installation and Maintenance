HERITAGE COMMONS HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION
Guidlines for Satellite Dish and Antenna Installation and Maintenance

This document sets forth the policies of the Heritage Commons Homeowners Association for the

installation and maintenance of satellite dishes and television antennas within the Heritage Commons
condominium project, pursuant to Section 207 of the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the
Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions for Heritage Commons Homeowners Association, as
amended from time to time (collectively, the “Declaration").

DEFINITIONS

All capitalized terms that are not otherwise defined in these Guidelines shail have the meanings
ascribed to them in the Declaration.

NOTIFICATION

Before installing a satellite dish or wireless cable antenna system (“Antenna”), Owners are requested
to notify the Association of their intent. Owners are encouraged to work with the Association and its
Board to determine a suitable location for the Antenna. That location should be the least obtrusive
possible without unreasonably delaying the Antenna's installation, unreasonably increasing the cost of

its installation, maintenance or use or preventing the Owner from obtaining an acceptable quality signal.

” | ANTENNA TYPE AND SIZE

For the purposes of these Guidelines, the term "Antenna" includes any direct broadcast system (DBS)
satellite dish or wireless cable antenna system (MDS or MMDS) and any component of or addition to
such antenna, including, without limitation, poles, masts, brackets, cables, or wiring.

These Guidelines apply to DBS, MDS and MMDS antennas that are one (1) meter or less in diameter
or diagonal measurement. Larger antennas are not permitted without the prior approval of the Board
of Directors.

INSTALLATION

Antennas may be located only on an Owner's balcony, patio (garden area) or deck, however, if an
acceptable quality signal can be received by placing the antenna inside the Unit, without an
unreasonable delay or increase in cost, then outdoor installation is prohibited. To the maximum

extent possible, Antennas should be installed where they are shielded from view from other Units or
the Common Area.

Installation must be in accordance with all applicable building, fire, electrical and related codes. If
installed outdoors, installation shall be by a licensed and insured installer knowledgeable about the
proper installation of Antennas. All installations shall be in accordance with the manufacturer's
installation specifications.
